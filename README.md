# Overview

This is the hyperledger project in MIS 385N Blockchain Technology Team 1

Two files are updated.
hyperledger-checking-account/fabric-samples/checking-account/app-js/app.js
hyperledger-checking-account/fabric-samples/checking-account/chaincode-js/lib/assetTransfer.js

We run our code by copying the above two files into the fabric-samples directory in the virtual machine provided by the class. All other commands are the same as presented on the slide of April 21 (deploy chaincode and run app.js).
